# SƒÅfi, a basic app-based firewall for Android [WIP]
A tiny Android app that allows to block network traffic in and out of apps by acting as a VPN.

***Not particularly useful right now but I hope to use this as vessel for trying a few things out e.g. handling different screen sizes in Compose UI, maybe some Rust FFI stuff, etc, etc***
